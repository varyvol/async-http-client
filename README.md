Async Http Client
-----------------

Fork of [async-http-client](https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client) to be able to include custom changes into the
library. Specifically this fork was created under [JENKINS-54601](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-54601) to be able to
include some security changes from 1.9.40 into 1.7.X

Deploying and releasing this requires some environmental circumstances that can be fulfilled as explained in [RELEASE.adoc](./RELEASE.adoc)
